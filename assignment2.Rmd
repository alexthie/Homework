1. **Working with data** In the `datasets` folder on the course GitHub repo, you will find a file called `cancer.csv`, which is a dataset in comma-separated values (csv) format. This is a large cancer incidence dataset that summarizes the incidence of different cancers for various subgroups. (18 points)

    1. Load the data set into R and make it a data frame called `cancer.df`. (2 points)
    
```{r}
cancer.df = read.csv("cancer.csv")
```

    2. Determine the number of rows and columns in the data frame. (2)
    
```{r}
nrow(cancer.df)
ncol(cancer.df)
```
> nrow(cancer.df)
[1] 42120
> ncol(cancer.df)
[1] 8

    3. Extract the names of the columns in `cancer.df`. (2)
    
```{r}
colnames(cancer.df)

```
[1] "year"       "site"       "state"      "sex"        "race"      
[6] "mortality"  "incidence"  "population"

    4. Report the value of the 3000th row in column 6. (2)
    
```{r}
cancer.df[3000, 6]

```
[1] 350.69
    5. Report the contents of the 172nd row. (2)
    
```{r}
cancer.df[172, 1:8]

```
 year                           site  state  sex  race mortality
172 1999 Brain and Other Nervous System nevada Male Black         0
    incidence population
172         0      73172

    6. Create a new column that is the incidence *rate* (per 100,000) for each row.(3)
```{r}
cancer.df$rate <- (100000 * cancer.df$incidence) / cancer.df$population

```

    7. How many subgroups (rows) have a zero incidence rate? (2)
```{r}
sum(cancer.df$rate==0)

```
[1] 23191
    8. Find the subgroup with the highest incidence rate.(3)
    
```{r}
which.max(cancer.df$rate)

```
[1] 5797
2. **Data types** (10 points)

    1. Create the following vector: `x <- c("5","12","7")`. Which of the following commands will produce an error message? For each command, Either explain why they should be errors, or explain the non-erroneous result. (4 points)

            max(x)
            sort(x)
            sum(x)
            
        
> x <- c("5","12","7")
> max(x)
[1] "7"
> sort(x)
[1] "12" "5"  "7" 
> sum(x)
Error in sum(x) : invalid 'type' (character) of argument
> #only sum(x) will produce an error meassage, because the data are character objects
> # and can not be summed up

    2. For the next two commands, either explain their results, or why they should produce errors. (3 points)

            y <- c("5",7,12)
            y[2] + y[3]
            
> y <- c("5",7,12)
> y[2] + y[3]
Error in y[2] + y[3] : non-numeric argument to binary operator
> #If a vector contains different data types, not only numbers,
> #the numbers in the vector can not be used for mathematical 
> #calculations in this way anymore.

    3. For the next two commands, either explain their results, or why they should produce errors. (3 points)

            z <- data.frame(z1="5",z2=7,z3=12)
            z[1,2] + z[1,3]
> z <- data.frame(z1="5",z2=7,z3=12)
> z[1,2] + z[1,3]
[1] 19
> # The first command creates a data frame with 3 columns and 1 row,
> #The second command adds the values of the of the second and third 
> #column in the first row.

3. **Data structures** Give R expressions that return the following matrices and vectors (*i.e.* do not construct them manually). (3 points each, 12 total)

    1. $(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1)$
```{r}
c(seq(1:8),seq(7,1))
```
 
 
    2. $(1,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5)$
```{r}

    3. $\begin{pmatrix}
      0 & 1 & 1  \\
      1 & 0 & 1  \\
      1 & 1 & 0  \\

      1 & 16 & 81 & 256 \\
      1 & 32 & 243 & 1024  \\
    \end{pmatrix}$

```


4. **Basic programming** (10 points)

    1. Let $h(x,n)=1+x+x^2+\ldots+x^n = \sum_{i=0}^n x^i$. Write an R program to calculate $h(x,n)$ using a `for` loop. (5 points)
    
```{r}
#n=0
#x=0
#for (i in seq (along=n)){ 
#h(x,n)=1+x+x^2+x^n=sum(i=0)^n = sum(x^i)
#}

    1. If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Write an R program to perform the following calculations. (5 points)

  if ((n%%3==0) || (n%%5==0)){
    totala <- totala +n

    1. Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be $(1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89)$. Write an R program to calculate the sum of the first 15 even-valued terms. (5 bonus points, [euler2])
```{r}   
#assure value is numeric
c <- numeric()
#define starting values
c[1] <- 1
c[2] <- 1
i <- 3
#create repeat loop, end if 3x15 as only every 3rd value in 
#fibonacci series is even
repeat{  
  c[i] <- c[i-1] + c[i-2]
  if (i > 45) break
  i <- i + 1
}

c <- c[1:i-1]

#add all even values together
sum(c[c %% 2 == 0])
```
